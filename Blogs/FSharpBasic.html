<h1 class="Title">Beginning F# Learn F# .Net Programmers</h1>
</div>
<p>
F# is a functional-first, general purpose, strongly typed,
multi-paradigm programming language that encompasses functional,
imperative, and object-oriented programming methods.
</p>
<b>Lets Start</b>
<h2>Requirement:-</h2> 
<p>
General Knowledge of .Net and Basic Understanding of C#.
F# is a functional language. In F#, functions work like data types. 
You can declare and use a function in the same way like any other variable.
 In general, an F# application does not have any specific entry point. 
 The compiler executes all top-level statements in the file from top to bottom.
However, to follow procedural programming style, many applications keep a single
 top level statement that calls the main loop.
</p>
<h2>Hello World</h2>
<div class="code">
<code>
 printfn “Hello World”
</code>
</div>
<p>
Actually some of the differences include it is not at all similiar to C#
 directly in rules such as semi colon and paranthese.
