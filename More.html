<h2>History</h2>
<h3>2020</h3>
<p>
HTML is the first thing i know in markup since my school but then i just became a expert in HTML and able to use Css and Js in a better way.
But then i written back to game maker 8.1 and continued making games like fruit catch, car racers and ball to hole in game maker and they weren't a good attraction because they were legacy and new ones have better feature like 3d and many more. I then used a rpg maker which my friend had in a dvd. Then i went to scratch site and then soon realised scratch was cross platform and 3.0 is the newest version. Then i replicated the games i made with game maker easily and then i left the game maker. Then my whole game making and programming were going in scratch. 
Then soon i tried to make a operating system simulation called solar os which was the most successful project i have made in scratch and i updated it and the Solar Os Ultimate was out which gained little less attraction then before. I was dismotivated but didn't give up and continued to make the Solar Os 2 which was a long term project with support from Late August 2020  - January. But it gained really High Reputation and have also reached the Top 100 in Trending. After Solar Os Ultimate i contributed to the Nova Os which is a quite good and mature os. Also soon Solar Os 2 got a gradual decline backwards. I also saw many advance os then mine with better UI. So i decided to help out the Other Os'es and gain os reputation in scratch. Also in the end of the year i understand for the first time slightly about making programming language kind of simulators in scratch.

<h3>2019</h3>
<p>
I used a programming language called scratch which is in version 1.4 to make my games and simple animations. I knew it before but didn't use it for enough time. I have no idea about almost everything i written here.
I started searching for easy game makers and kind of stuff other than scratch with publishing abilities. I tried out Game Maker, Construct 2 and Unity as well but Construct 2 and Unity weren't suitable for me so i continued with Game Maker 8.1 but it was becoming harder and asking for currency i abandoned devolopment in it. 
This is when i got support from my brother and some friends.
